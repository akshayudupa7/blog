                        <p>Mobile blogging (also known as moblogging) is a method of publishing to a website or blog from a mobile 
                            phone or other handheld device. A moblog helps habitual bloggers to post write-ups directly from their phones
                             even when on the move. Mobile blogging has been made possible by technological convergence, as bloggers have
                              been able to write, record and upload different media all from a single, mobile device. At the height of its
                               growth in 2006, mobile blogging experienced 70,000 blog creations a day and 29,100 blog posts an hour.</p>
